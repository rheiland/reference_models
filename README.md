# reference_models

These are intended to demo models with limited scope, to illustrate specific concepts. They should contain the necessary 
files to re-load and re-run in PhysiCell. Each subdirectory is likely to contain the files of a PhysiCell "user_project", i.e., from having done a:
```
make save PROJ=project_name
```
In addition, each subdirectory in this repo may contain a .gif to demo the model.
